## Project Brief:
* **Consume a public API** – this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* **Have several components**
* **The app can have a router** - with several "pages", this is up to you and if it makes sense for your project.
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public (hosted on your public github, not GA github!)
​
## Timeframe:
2.5 Days
 
## Description:
The Lord of the Rings Quiz App allows you to play two quizzes - the first a 'Guess Which Character Said' quotes quiz, and the second a 'Guess Which Movie This Quote Is From' quiz that only covers the LotR movie trilogy. There are 20 questions for each quiz and you score points whether you get a question right. The player gets a different LotR gif depending on their quiz score.
